  cannon: 'Fires at distant hexes to damage defenders and clear forests and blast passes through mountains. Needs a reload between shots. Unlocked through research.',
  trench: 'Dug into the ground and links up with neighbouring trenches. Click it to station up to 20 troops, who man the line when attacked and defend 35% better. You can also attack straight out of it. Enemy tanks within 2 hexes cancel the bonus.',

  tank: 'Attacks into hexes within 2 of it are 60% stronger and ignore enemy trenches. When your troops take a hex next to it, the tank rolls forward onto it. Unlocked through research.',
